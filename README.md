## What is a Thread?
A thread is a path of execution within a process. A process can contain multiple threads.
## Why Multithreading?
A thread is also known as lightweight process. The idea is to achieve parallelism by dividing a process into multiple threads. For example, in a browser, multiple tabs can be different threads. MS Word uses multiple threads: one thread to format the text, another thread to process inputs, etc.
